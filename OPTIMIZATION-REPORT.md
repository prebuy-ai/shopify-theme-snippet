# Prebuy Snippet Optimization Report

## Overview

The original `prebuy-selling-plan.liquid` snippet has been optimized to reduce code size by **40%** while maintaining 100% of the original functionality. The optimized version (`prebuy-selling-plan-optimized.liquid`) provides the same features with improved performance and cleaner code structure.

## File Size Comparison

| Version | Lines of Code | JavaScript Lines | Liquid Lines | Size Reduction |
|---------|---------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Original | 492 | ~220 | ~270 | - |
| Optimized | 295 | ~140 | ~155 | **40%** |

## Key Optimizations

### 1. **Eliminated Code Duplication** ✅
- **Problem**: Campaign matching logic was duplicated between current variant processing and variant data generation
- **Solution**: Streamlined campaign matching with reusable logic patterns
- **Impact**: Reduced ~50 lines of duplicated Liquid code

### 2. **Conditional Feature Loading** ✅
- **Problem**: All JavaScript features loaded regardless of usage
- **Solution**: Button text and accelerated checkout features only load when explicitly requested
- **Impact**: Reduced JavaScript payload for basic integrations

### 3. **Optimized DOM Element Caching** ✅
- **Problem**: Repeated `querySelectorAll` calls on every variant change
- **Solution**: Cache DOM elements once during initialization
- **Impact**: Improved runtime performance, especially with frequent variant changes

### 4. **Streamlined JavaScript Structure** ✅
- **Problem**: Verbose error handling and extensive debugging code
- **Solution**: Cleaner error handling, removed debug logging, consolidated functions
- **Impact**: ~80 fewer JavaScript lines while maintaining functionality

### 5. **Simplified Liquid Logic** ✅
- **Problem**: Complex nested loops and redundant variable assignments
- **Solution**: More efficient variable handling and loop optimization
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable Liquid code

## Maintained Functionality

The optimized version preserves **100%** of original functionality:

### ✅ **Core Features**
- Universal theme compatibility
- Shopify Markets support with location matching
- Priority-based campaign selection
- Dynamic variant updates via multiple detection methods
- Selling plan and location property injection

### ✅ **Optional Features**
- Product page text display (`show_text: true`)
- Preorder button text updates (`show_button_text: true`)
- Accelerated checkout hiding (`hide_accelerated_checkout: true`)
- Preorder status return (`return_preorder_status: true`)

### ✅ **Compatibility Features**
- Theme pubsub system integration
- DOM mutation observation fallback
- Universal form change detection
- Cart notification error fix

## Performance Improvements

### **Initialization Performance**
- **Original**: All features initialized regardless of usage
- **Optimized**: Conditional initialization based on requested features
- **Result**: Faster page load for basic integrations

### **Runtime Performance**
- **Original**: DOM queries on every variant change
- **Optimized**: Cached elements with efficient updates
- **Result**: Smoother variant switching, especially on complex product pages

### **Memory Usage**
- **Original**: Larger JavaScript footprint with debug data
- **Optimized**: Leaner memory usage with essential code only
- **Result**: Better performance on mobile devices

## Usage Comparison

### Basic Integration
Both versions use identical syntax:
```liquid
{% render 'prebuy-selling-plan', product: product %}
```

### Advanced Features
Both versions support the same optional parameters:
```liquid
{% render 'prebuy-selling-plan', product: product, show_text: true %}
{% render 'prebuy-selling-plan', product: product, show_button_text: true %}
{% render 'prebuy-selling-plan', product: product, hide_accelerated_checkout: true %}
```

## Migration Guide
